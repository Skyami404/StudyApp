# Study App Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to address the reported issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Music/Background Sounds Not Playing

**Problem**: The "Add Music" button wasn't playing any actual audio - it was just a placeholder.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `musicService.js` to use Expo AV for actual audio playback
- Added real audio URLs for ambient sounds (rain, white noise, forest, ocean, cafe, fireplace)
- Implemented proper audio initialization and cleanup
- Added error handling with user-friendly fallback messages
- Updated `MusicControls.js` to initialize the music service on component mount

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/musicService.js`
- `src/components/MusicControls.js`

### 2. Calendar Events and Scheduled Study Times

**Problem**: The calendar screen didn't show scheduled study times and had poor visual organization.

**Solution**:
- Added a dedicated "Scheduled Study Sessions" section at the top
- Implemented notification tracking to show all scheduled study reminders
- Added ability to cancel scheduled study sessions
- Improved visual design with icons and better organization
- Added pull-to-refresh functionality
- Enhanced empty states with helpful icons and messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/CalendarScreen.js`

### 3. Empty Stats Screen

**Problem**: The stats screen was completely empty with just placeholder text.

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned the stats screen with comprehensive statistics
- Added stat cards showing today's study time, weekly progress, and current streak
- Implemented today's sessions list with method icons and durations
- Added expandable recent sessions history
- Included data management features (clear all data)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/screens/StatsScreen.js`
